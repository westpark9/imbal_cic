"""FlashAttention-3 (Hopper) backend availability and dispatch.

FA3 ships as the ``flash_attn_interface`` package built from the ``hopper/``
directory of Dao-AILab/flash-attention. It is Hopper-only (sm_90 WGMMA/TMA);
Blackwell will need FA4. See ``fa3_setup.md`` next to this file for build
instructions. FA3 supports head dims ``{64, 96, 128, 192, 256}`` and requires
fp16/bf16 inputs.
