    Several configuration options for inference are exposed in the `TabPFNClassifier`

    not expected to be changed by the (standard) user.

    Several of the preprocessing options are supported by our code for efficiency
    reasons (to avoid loading TabPFN multiple times). However, these can also be
    applied outside of the model interface.

    This class must be serializable as it is peristed in the model checkpoints.
