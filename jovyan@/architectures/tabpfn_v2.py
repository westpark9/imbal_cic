"""The TabPFN v2 model, implemented as a single file.

This is a single-file reimplementation of v2, replacing the multi-file ``base``
architecture. Like the base architecture, it loads the positional embeddings from disk
for the production seed 42 (see :meth:`TabPFNV2.add_column_embeddings`, so their values
are consistent across devices) and supports a KV cache for fast inference (an explicit
cache passed through :meth:`TabPFNV2.forward`, see :class:`TabPFNV2Cache`).

Although the transformer layers have been renamed/restructured relative to the base
architecture, checkpoints trained with the base architecture can still be loaded: see
:meth:`TabPFNV2.load_state_dict`, which translates the old key names on the fly.
